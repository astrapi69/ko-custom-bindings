# Skip binding

You can use this binding for skip bindings if you want to bind it yourself in your code. A common case is if you want to integrate html code that contains other ko bindings. You can find a good documentation of it at [Quick Tip: Telling Knockout to Skip Binding Part of a Page](http://www.knockmeout.net/2012/05/quick-tip-skip-binding.html), the author is a team member from the knockout developer team.
